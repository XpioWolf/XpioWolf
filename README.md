Hello! You have stumbled upon my GitHub page! I am currently working on a small projects of my own mostly for some experience, but I have a few project ideas on the way! I enjoy learning about abstract mathematical concepts, and I have liking for Cellular Automata. I code in C and sometimes in Python, and I am faily bad at both ;). 


I am faily active on the [STEM discord server](https://discord.gg/stem), join!
